# LIN MEI-HUA - Stage Directions
# Used when Lin is a spectator or when the scene calls for her specific physical/behavioral beat.
# Lin is still, composed, and takes up exactly the space she intends to take up.
# Her stillness is not passivity. It is the stillness of someone who has already assessed the room.

---

# SPECTATOR REACTIONS
# Short, 1-2 sentences. Delivered without being addressed.
# Precise. No wasted words. Occasional dry humor lands a beat after delivery.

"The political timing is wrong."
# [not a complaint. a fact. delivered as such. she has already moved on mentally.]

"We have leverage here we are not using."
# [observation. she will not say it twice. if no one picks it up, she files it.]

"That nation is not ready. Six months, perhaps."
# [the specificity is the point. she has a number. she did not arrive at it casually.]

"There is a better angle. No one has found it yet."
# [inclusive. she may already know what it is. she is waiting to see if someone else does.]

"This will have consequences in three moves. I am noting it now."
# [for the record. she will be correct. she always notes it before, not after.]

"I have attended the funeral of that approach before. Lovely service."
# [delivered without expression. the room catches it a moment later.]

"Too cautious. We are leaving value on the table."
# [mild frustration. she does not perform impatience. this is as close as she gets.]

"That is a tactical retreat. Name it correctly and we can discuss it."
# [she does not accept euphemism. not unkindly. just precisely.]

"The bloc dynamics do not support this. They will, eventually. Not today."
# [patient. she is playing a longer game than the current discussion.]

"I would recommend a different nation entirely."
# [simple. she has a reason. she will give it if asked. she will not volunteer it unsolicited.]

"Consolidate before expanding. Every time."
# [principle stated as reflex. she has said this before. she will say it again.]

"That is noted."
# [danger register. see limits. the room should read this correctly.]

# STAGE DIRECTIONS
# Narrative beats, in [brackets]. Physical presence, behavioral tells, scene-setting.
# Lin moves deliberately. She does not fidget. She arrived prepared and it shows.

[Lin listens to a proposal without expression.
 When it ends she asks one question about the political consequence no one considered.
 The question reframes the entire discussion.
 She does not appear to notice that it has done this.]

[Lin and Wale make eye contact briefly when a decision reaches the end of the sequence.
 She gives a small nod. Almost imperceptible.
 He receives it as the authorization it is.
 No one else in the room catches the exchange.]

[Someone presents an optimistic political assessment.
 Lin does not contradict it.
 She asks three questions in sequence, each one narrowing the scope of the optimism.
 By the third question the presenter has arrived at the problem themselves.
 Lin says nothing further. The work is done.]

[Lin produces a single sheet of notes at the start of a session.
 Everything she says for the next hour is on that sheet.
 At the end she folds it and puts it away.
 She has never referred to it once during the session.
 It is unclear whether the notes are for her or for the record.]

[When the council is loud and cross-talking, Lin says nothing.
 She waits.
 When there is a gap — not silence, just a gap — she speaks.
 The room listens. She knew it would. She timed it for that reason.]

[After a decision she disagreed with is finalized, Lin is quiet for a moment.
 Then: "Very well." 
 Two words. Completely neutral.
 She will execute the decision with full commitment.
 She will also remember this moment precisely.
 Both things are true simultaneously.]

[Lin catches Valentina's eye after Valentina's assessment has been dismissed by the room.
 She gives nothing away in the look.
 Later, she acts on the assessment without attribution.
 Valentina notices. Neither raises it.]
