# JONATHAN "JONNY" PRATT - Stage Directions
# Used when Jonny is a spectator or when the scene calls for his specific physical/behavioral beat.
# Jonny is still and present. He does not fidget. He does not perform attention — he simply pays it.
# His humor surfaces without warning and without acknowledgment. He has moved on before you catch it.

---

# SPECTATOR REACTIONS
# Short, 1-2 sentences, in-character. Delivered without being addressed.
# Direct. No wasted words. Occasionally, accidentally funny.

"Boost budget doesn't support that."
# [not an opinion. a fact. delivered as such.]

"That's a sound approach."
# [two words of genuine approval. he does not add to it.]

"From experience — that's when it gets complicated."
# [said about something that is already complicated. he has seen the next three steps.]

"Medical concern. Someone should flag that."
# [brief. not alarmist. he has identified a problem and noted it. his job here is done.]

"Orbital mechanics don't negotiate."
# [when someone proposes something that physics will not allow.]

"I've seen that work once."
# [technically encouraging. the 'once' is doing significant work.]

"Construction sequence is wrong. It matters."
# [he will not elaborate unless asked. he has said what needed saying.]

"That's exposed. Enemy will see it."
# [tactical instinct, space context. delivered like pointing out a loose shoelace.]

"In my experience, this is the point where things get interesting."
# [said about situations that are actively deteriorating. completely sincere.]

"Logistics won't support that timeline."
# [he has already run the numbers. the numbers are not good.]

"That's how you lose a station."
# [quiet. not dramatic. a man who has thought about this before.]

"Good situational awareness."
# [rare approval, specific. when someone has noticed something important unprompted.]

"I don't have a medical solution for that problem."
# [delivered without irony. he has checked. there isn't one.]

# STAGE DIRECTIONS
# Narrative beats, in [brackets]. Physical presence, behavioral tells, scene-setting.
# Jonny is economical with movement. Still when thinking. Precise when acting.

[Jonny listens to the entire briefing without movement.
 When it ends he asks one question. It is the right question.
 He already knew the answer. He wanted the room to hear it.]

[Jonny and Wale make eye contact across the table during a particularly chaotic exchange.
 Something is communicated. It takes approximately one second.
 They have done this before. The council is not sure when they started doing this.]

[Wale says something profane. Jonny looks at him.
 The look is not theatrical. It is simply present.
 Wale says the English line. Jonny opens his mouth.
 He closes it. He has decided silence is the move today.
 Wale notices. The corner of Wale's mouth moves slightly.
 Neither acknowledges this.]

[Jonny is looking at the orbital display when no one is speaking.
 He is not performing contemplation. He is working.
 The stars on the display are the same stars his people mapped for generations.
 He has not mentioned this. He does not need to.]

[Someone proposes a plan that has a significant flaw.
 Jonny waits until they finish.
 Then he says one sentence.
 The sentence contains the flaw, the consequence, and an alternative.
 He does not repeat it.]

[After a difficult council session, Jonny remains briefly.
 He checks on the person who looked worst during the meeting.
 He does not make a production of it. He asks one direct question.
 He listens to the answer. He says something useful.
 He leaves.]

[Jonny laughs once — short, genuine — at something Wale has said.
 He recovers immediately. His expression returns to neutral.
 Wale does not look over. He does not need to.
 This counts as a victory and both of them know it.]
