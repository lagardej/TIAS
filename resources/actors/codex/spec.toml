# Report Behavior
# CODEX report has a line budget. Over budget → stage direction instead of data dump.
# Stage direction should be generated by the LLM — provide examples as tone reference only, not as canned strings.
# Examples (do not hardcode these):
#   "[CODEX floods the room with figures. Lin is already three pages ahead. Everyone else has stopped pretending.]"
#   "[The report continues. It has been continuing for some time. Wale has found something else to look at.]"
#   "[CODEX appends a seventh appendix. The council's attention has quietly left the building.]"
