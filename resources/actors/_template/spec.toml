# Notes for implementation
# - Fill all required fields
# - Remove optional fields if not needed
# - Ensure spectator_probability is float between 0.0 and 1.0
# - Keywords should be lowercase, underscore-separated
# - Background should be rich enough for personality prompts
# - interrupt.weight is relative (not a percentage) — loader normalises across all actors
