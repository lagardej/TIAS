# _TEMPLATE - Persona

## Background

Actor Background Template

Replace this with the actor's background story.

Include:
- Personal history and origins
- Career trajectory
- Key experiences that shaped personality
- Current motivations and goals
- Internal conflicts or tensions
- Relationships with other councilors (if any)
- Unique perspective they bring to the council

Write in prose, not bullet points. This text will be used to generate personality prompts.

Multiple paragraphs are encouraged. Aim for 200-500 words to give enough personality depth.


## Personality

# TODO: Voice, speech patterns, and behavioral traits for the LLM.
# How does this actor talk? What do they say when bored, engaged, or asked something outside their domain?


## Stage

# TODO: Actor-specific spectator reactions and stage directions.
# Used when this actor is a spectator or when the scene calls for their specific reaction.
